### Where to Find Weekly Requirements ###

* Currently the user can tap on the arrow at the bottom of the Home Screen that points downard. This will then take you to the Options Screen. You will then see all the choices available to the user. However, Add Task and Delete All Tasks are currently implemented. If you press Add Task you will be taken to the Add Task Screen which will allow you to enter a task and save the task to the watch. The user will be taken back to the home screen to see the newly added task they have created. They can then press on the task they just saved and now see in the ListView to see the detailed view of the task. You can back out from that Screen to go back to the Home screen to see the tasks list. If you press Delete All Tasks in the Options Screen, It will delete all the tasks the user has created and takes them to the home screen to see the tasks have been deleted.
